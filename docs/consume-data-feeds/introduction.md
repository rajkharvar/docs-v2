The Razor Network Oracle now operates on the Europa DeFi Hub, providing a robust layer of security with its Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Price feed data is sourced from the Razor Oracle and bridged seamlessly to EVM-compatible chains, ensuring high levels of accuracy and decentralization across connected networks.

Razor Network Oracle Datafeeds can be integrated into smart contracts using `Transparent Forwarder` interface. Supported chains and contract addresses can be found [here](/docs/consume-data-feeds/deployment-details#supported-chains). Details regarding Transparent Forwarder can be found [here](/docs/consume-data-feeds/transparent-forwarder).
