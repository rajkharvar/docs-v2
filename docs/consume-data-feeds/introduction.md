The Razor Network Oracle runs on its own chain, the Razor Schain, together with Proof of Stake and its consensus mechanism gives a high level of security to the chain. Price feed data is bridged to EVM-compatible chains from Razor Schain.

Razor Network Oracle Datafeeds can be integrated into smart contracts using `Transparent Forwarder` interface. Supported chains and contract addresses can be found [here](/docs/consume-data-feeds/deployment-details#supported-chains). Details regarding Transparent Forwarder can be found [here](/docs/consume-data-feeds/transparent-forwarder).
